     * Doing it the other way round can cause data inconsistencies, because syncing files
     * to the store takes time, it is done sequentially, and in the meanwhile, other
     * modifications can happen:
     * - Store last syncDate is 12:29:00
     * - Data directory is modified at 12:30:00
     * - We ask for modified files after 12:29:00 and got 3 files (1.json, 2.json and 3.json)
     * - File "1.json" is processed and added to the store at 12:30:01
     * - While "2.json" is being processed and added to the store, data directory is modified
     * again at 12:30:02 and "1.json" is changed.
     * - File "3.json" is processed and added to the store at 12:30:03
     *
     * At this moment, there are two options:
     *
     * 1) Setting syncDate to the current date:
     * - Store syncDate is set to 12:30:03
     * - Data directory is modified again at 12:30:10 and only "3.json" is changed
     * - We ask for modified files after 12:30:03 and get only "3.json"
     * - Modification done at 12:30:02 to "1.json" is lost and cannot be recovered unless "1.json" is
     * modified again, or Data Server is restarted
     *
     * 2) Setting syncDate to the last modification date of the data directory:
     * - Store syncDate is set to 12:30:00
     * - Data directory is modified again at 12:30:10 and only "3.json" is changed
     * - We ask for modified files after 12:30:00 and get "1.json" and "3.json"
     * - Modification done at 12:30:02 to "1.json" is properly processed
